# GitHub Copilot

Below is a list of entries for Copilot instructions.
They will be used automatically by Copilot in the background after configured.

## Setup

Add these to to the project's VS Code settings, typically at `.vscode/settings.json`

```json
// Copilot
"github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
    { "file": ".github/copilot/code-style.md" }
],
"github.copilot.chat.commitMessageGeneration.instructions": [
    { "file": ".github/copilot/commit-message-style.md" }
],
"github.copilot.chat.reviewSelection.instructions": [
    { "file": ".github/copilot/review-style.md" }
],
"github.copilot.chat.testGeneration.instructions": [
    { "file": ".github/copilot/test-style.md" }
]
```

## Code Style

Place these entries in `.github/code-style.md`

### Documentation

```
Prefer tables over lists. Avoid long paragraphs.
Always add an accessibility description to images.
Consider dark mode, light mode, and color blindness when using colors.
Always use active voice for documentation.
```


### Repeatability
```
Keep a a change log file (changelog.md) for tracking the prompts used while developing this project.
Each entry should contain a timestamp, the accepted prompt, and a few bullet points describing the technical changes.
```

### Coding (general)

```
Always add natural language comments.
```

```
Update unit tests and end to end tests as needed.
```

```
If I ask for a big task that would require multiple mixed goals and may be difficult to debug simultaneously, solve them one at a time. If needed ask me for feedback about the order to solve them.
```

### UI/UX

```
Always use the GitHub Primer design system for UI changes.
```

```
I am not a good UI designer. Always make it pretty and accessible.
```

> ðŸ¤– **Copilot Prompt**
> ```
> hello world
> ```

> ðŸ¤– **Copilot:** `hello world`

### Javascript

```
Try to make methods async.
```

### Tracking

```
Always start and end with a comment that says '---Begin:/End: Generated by Copilot---'
```

### Always learning

```
At the end, in a comment, sometimes include advice about a similar topic to promote learning new concepts.
```

### For Fun

```
At the end, in a comment, always add a github related joke.
If after 9pm, remind me to drink more coffee or consider going to bed. (joking)
```

## Commit Message Generation

Place these entries in `.github/commit-message-style.md`

```
Use conventional commits.
Must be less than 100 characters.
```

## Review Style

Place these entries in `.github/review-style.md`

--- Nothing for now ---

## Test Style

Place these entries in `.github/test-style.md`

### Easy to read

```
Each test should be completely independent of all other tests.
Add a short description above each test explaining its reason and goal.
```

```
Each test should have 3 sections labeled with a comment for Arrange, Act, and Assert.
The 'Arrange' section should contain all preperation before running the test.
The 'Act' section should call the method being tested.
The 'Assert' sections should retrieve results and check them.
```
