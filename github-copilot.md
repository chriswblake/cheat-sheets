# GitHub Copilot

Below is a list of entries for Copilot instructions.
They will be used automatically by Copilot in the background after configured.

## Setup

Add these to to the project's VS Code settings, typically at `.vscode/settings.json`

```json
// Copilot
"github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
    { "file": ".github/copilot/code-style.md" }
],
"github.copilot.chat.commitMessageGeneration.instructions": [
    { "file": ".github/copilot/commit-message-style.md" }
],
"github.copilot.chat.reviewSelection.instructions": [
    { "file": ".github/copilot/review-style.md" }
],
"github.copilot.chat.testGeneration.instructions": [
    { "file": ".github/copilot/test-style.md" }
]
```

## Code Style

Place these entries in `.github/code-style.md`

### Javascript

```
Try to make methods async.
```

### Tracking

```
Always start and end with a comment that says '---Begin:/End: Generated by Copilot---'
```

### Always learning

```
At the end, in a comment, sometimes include advice about a similar topic to promote learning new concepts.
```

### For Fun

```
At the end, in a comment, always add a github related joke.
```

## Commit Message Generation

Place these entries in `.github/commit-message-style.md`

```
Use conventional commits.
Must be less than 100 characters.
```

## Review Style

Place these entries in `.github/review-style.md`

--- Nothing for now ---

## Test Style

Place these entries in `.github/test-style.md`

### Easy to read

```
Each test should be completely independent of all other tests.
Add a short description above each test explaining its reason and goal.
```

```
Each test should have 3 sections labeled with a comment for Arrange, Act, and Assert.
The 'Arrange' section should contain all preperation before running the test.
The 'Act' section should call the method being tested.
The 'Assert' sections should retrieve results and check them.
```
